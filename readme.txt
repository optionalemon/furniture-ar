Notes
-   Move the phone screen around to detect plane, may take a while to load and show the planes available before we can put any furniture.
-   Implemented using iOS not sure if it will be functional with Android.
-   Please find me at E0772330@u.nus.edu if any issue encountered. My teammate has dropped this module so I thought would be better to do it myself rather than troubling her T.T
